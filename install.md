# Installing Jack and Jacktrip

## Installing Jack

Jack is essentially an audio patching software. Think about how a synth box works: you connect input and output sources via wires ("jacks") to create new sounds. Jack works the same way, but within your computer: it can route audio from one program to another.

To download the most recent version of Jack for Windows or OS X, [visit the Jack website.](https://jackaudio.org/downloads/)
(As of 8/21/20, the Windows and OS X software links are no longer available on this site. Check out [this Wayback link](https://web.archive.org/web/20200808125552/https://jackaudio.org/downloads/) for an older version of this page with download links.)

You will need to restart your computer after installation. After you have done so, you will notice that Jack exists as a folder on your computer. JackPilot and qjackctl (Q Jack Control) both function as graphic interfaces for Jack; here, we'll use JackPilot.

Upon opening JackPilot, you'll be navigated to a settings window (you can get here again by selecting __JackPilot â†’ Preferences__ in OS X):
