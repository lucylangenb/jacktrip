# Running a Server

These are mostly personal notes for myself. Only one person needs to run the server, while everyone else can connect to the server as clients.

Once we've begun to run JackTrip (by typing `jacktrip` into a new Terminal window) with Jack running in the background, enter the command `jacktrip -s` to enter server mode.
